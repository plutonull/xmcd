<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<DIR>

<I>Cda</I>

is a program that allows the use of the CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW or DVD
drive as a full-featured stereo compact-disc player and &quot;ripper&quot;
from the shell command line.  It can be used interactively in line
mode or visual (screen) mode, or as a script-driven utility.
This is a companion utility to <B><A HREF="xmcd.html">xmcd</A></B>(1),
a Motif-based CD audio player application
for the X window system.
<I>Cda</I>

uses the same configuration and support files as
<I>xmcd.</I>

<P>

Most of the features found on &quot;real&quot; CD players are available in
<I>cda,</I>

such as shuffle and repeat, and track programming functions.
<P>

CDDA (CD digital audio) data extraction, playback, save-to-file,
and pipe-to-program are supported on many platforms.  For
data extraction to file or pipe,
<I>cda</I>

can generate the data in MP3 (MPEG-1 layer 3), MPEG-2/MPEG-4 AAC, MP4
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, WAV, AU, AIFF, AIFF-C and raw headerless formats.
Simultaneous extraction to file/pipe and real-time playback is
possible on high performance computers.
<P>

Multi-disc changers are also supported.  You can switch to a
soecified disc, select to play only a single disc or auto-play all
discs in normal or reverse order.
<P>

The Gracenote CDDB&reg; Music Recognition Service(sm) feature is supported by
<I>cda,</I>

which allows the CD artist/title and track titles, and other
information associated with the loaded CD to be displayed.
For CDDA extraction to MP3, MP4, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC formats,
<I>cda</I>

can auto-fill the CD information tags embedded in these files.
<P>

This release of
<I>cda</I>

supports the enhanced Gracenote CDDB<SUP>2</SUP>&reg; service on a number of platforms,
and offers much richer features and content than the &quot;classic&quot; CDDB.
Moreover, CDDB<SUP>2</SUP>-supplied information is now in UTF-8
data format, providing international language support.
See &quot;LOCALIZATION&quot; below.
<P>

In addition to CDDB, this release of
<I>cda</I>

supports reading CD-TEXT data from the disc for the disc/track
artist and title information.
<P>

No capability is provided to add, modify or submit CDDB entries in
<I>cda.</I>

You must use the X-based <B><A HREF="xmcd.html">xmcd</A></B>(1) utility (or another
CDDB-enabled application with the appropriate features)
for that purpose.
<P>

On systems with more than one CD drive, multiple
invocations of
<I>cda</I>

can be used to operate each drive independently.
<P>

<I>Cda</I>

is designed to be easy to use, with particular care taken
to make all output easily parsable by other programs.
<P>

The internal architecture of
<I>cda</I>

is designed to be easily portable to many UNIX operating
system variants, and adaptable to the myriad of CD drives
available.

<A NAME="OPTIONS" id="OPTIONS">&nbsp;</A><A NAME="lbAE" id="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>OPTIONS</H3>
<DIR>

<I>Cda</I>

supports the following options:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>-dev&nbsp;device</I><DD>
Specifies the path name to the raw CD device.  If this option is
not used, the default device to be used is the first
drive set up with the
<I>xmcd</I>

configuration program (See below).
<DT><I>-batch</I><DD>
Signifies that
<I>cda</I>

should run in batch mode.  This suppresses all interaction with the
user (i.e., will not prompt the user to type anything).  Batch mode
is not meaningful in visual mode.
<DT><I>-online</I>, <I>-offline</I><DD>
Forces
<I>cda</I>

to enable or disable Internet access.  If this option is not specified,
then the default is configured via the <I>internetOffline</I>
parameter in the <B>common.cfg</B> file.  In offline mode, CDDB lookup will
only be done from the local cache.  Please note that the daemon
as well as the client will both perform CDDB lookups.  If you want
to disable Internet access in both, then the -offline option should be
used when you start the daemon via the <B>cda on</B> command, as well as
when you issue any
<I>cda</I>

client command.
<DT><I>-debug&nbsp;level#</I><DD>
Causes verbose debugging diagnostics to be displayed on <I>stderr</I>.
Note that if you are running in visual mode, the stderr output should
be redirected to a file, or the debug information will corrupt the
screen.  The level specifies the type of debugging messages desired:
<P>
<PRE>
1       General debugging
2       Device I/O debugging
4       CD information debugging
32      Sound DSP and output file/pipe debugging
64      Message of the day debugging
</PRE>

<P>
You may add the values together to enable multiple debugging types
(i.e., A value of 3 turns on both General and Device I/O debugging).
<P>
</DL>

</DIR>
<A NAME="COMMANDS" id="COMMANDS">&nbsp;</A><A NAME="lbAF" id="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>COMMANDS</H3>
<DIR>

<I>Cda</I>

supports the following commands:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>on</I><DD>
Start the
<I>cda daemon.</I>

<DT><I>off</I><DD>
Terminate the
<I>cda daemon.</I>

<DT><I>disc &lt;load | eject | prev | next | disc#&gt;</I><DD>
Load or eject the CD, or change discs on a multi-disc changer.
<DT><I>lock &lt;on | off&gt;</I><DD>
Enable/disable the CD disc lock.  When locked, the CD cannot be
ejected using the CD drive front-panel eject button.  You can only
change the lock state when a CD is loaded and is not playing.
<DT><I>play [track# [mm:ss]]</I><DD>
Start playback.  If the
<I>track#</I>

is used, the playback starts from the specified track.  The optional
<I>mm:ss</I>

argument specifies the minutes and seconds offset into
the track from where to start playback.
<DT><I>pause</I><DD>
Pauses the playback.  Use
<I>cda</I>

<B>play</B>
to resume playback.
<DT><I>stop</I><DD>
Stop the plaback.
<DT><I>track &lt;prev | next&gt;</I><DD>
Proceed to the previous or the next track.  This command is only
valid when playback is already in progress.
<DT><I>index &lt;prev | next&gt;</I><DD>
Proceed to the previous or the next index.  This command is only
valid when playback is already in progress.
<DT><I>program [clear | save | track# ...]</I><DD>
If no argument is specified, this command displays the current
program play sequence, if any.  The <B>clear</B> argument will
cause the current program to be cleared.  The <B>save</B> argument
will save the current program, so that a future load of the
same CD will automatically get the program sequence.
To define a new program, specify a list of track numbers separated
by spaces.  To start program play, use the <B>play</B> command.
You cannot define a new program while shuffle mode is enabled.
Entering a program will disengage shuffle mode.
<DT><I>shuffle &lt;on | off&gt;</I><DD>
Enable/disable shuffle play mode.  When shuffle is enabled,
<I>cda</I>

will play the CD tracks in a random order.  You can use this
command only when audio playback is not in progress.  Also,
you must clear any program sequence before enabling shuffle.
<DT><I>repeat &lt;on | off&gt;</I><DD>
Enable/disable the repeat mode.
<DT><I>volume [value# | linear | square | invsqr ]</I><DD>
If no argument is specified, this command displays the current
audio volume and taper setting.  If a
<I>value</I>

is used, then the audio volume level is set to the specified
value.  The valid range is 0 to 100.  If one of <B>linear</B>,
<B>square</B> or <B>invsqr</B> is specified, then the volume
control taper is set to the specified curve.  This control
operates the hardware volume control on the CD drive in <I>standard</I>
playback mode, or the computer's audio hardware in <I>cdda-play</I> mode.
It has no effect on the data of the <I>cdda-save</I> or <I>cdda-pipe</I>
outputs.
<DT><I>balance [value#]</I><DD>
If no argument is specified, this command displays the current
balance control setting.  If a
<I>value</I>

is used, then the balance is set to the specified value.
The valid range is 0 to 100, where 0 is full left, 50 is
center and 100 is full right.  This control operates the hardware
volume control on the CD drive in <I>standard</I> playback mode,
or the computer's audio hardware in <I>cdda-play</I> mode.  It has
no effect on the data of the <I>cdda-save</I> or <I>cdda-pipe</I>
outputs.
<DT><I>route [stereo | reverse | mono-l | mono-r | mono | value#]</I><DD>
If no argument is specified, this command displays the current
channel routing setting.  Otherwise, to set the routing, 
use one of the appropriate keywords
or a
<I>value</I>

as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
0       Normal stereo
1       Reverse stereo
2       Mono-L
3       Mono-R
4       Mono-L+R
</PRE>

<DT><I>outport [speaker | headphone | line-out | value#]</I><DD>
CDDA playback output port selection.  The <I>speaker</I>, <I>headphone</I>
and <I>line-out</I> keywords are toggles.  Alternatively, you may
specify a numeric <I>value</I>, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
1       Speaker
2       Headphone
4       Line-out
</PRE>

<P>
You may add the values together to enable multiple output ports
(i.e., A value of 3 turns on both Speaker and Headphones).
When the value is set to 0, the port setting is unmodified.
If no argument is specified, this command displays the current output
port setting.
Note that this command may be meaningful only on some platforms,
and only certain ports may be available on a particular architecture.
See the PLATFORM file for details.
<DT><I>cdda-att [value#]</I><DD>
If no argument is specified, this command displays the current
CDDA attenuator setting.  If a
<I>value</I>

is used, then the CDDA attenuator level is set to the specified
value.  The valid range is 0 to 100.  Note that in contrast to the
<I>volume</I> command, this setting does not operate any hardware.
It works by scaling the CDDA audio samples, and thus has no effect
in <I>standard</I> playback mode, but affects all CDDA modes
(<I>cdda-play</I>, <I>cdda-save</I> and <I>cdda-pipe</I>).
<DT><I>status [cont [secs#]]</I><DD>
Display the current disc status, disc number, track number,
index number, time, modes, and repeat count.  If the <B>cont</B>
argument is specified, then the display will run continuously
until the user types the interrupt character (typically <I>Delete</I> or
<I>Ctrl-C</I>).  The optional <B>secs</B> sub-argument is the
display update time interval.  The default is 1 second.
<DT><I>toc [offsets]</I><DD>
Display the CD Table of Contents.  The disc artist/title
and track titles associated with the current disc, queried from
CDDB, is also shown.  If the disc has associated notes or credits,
an asterisk (*) is displayed after the genre description.  Similarly,
if a track has associated notes or credits, an asterisk is
displayed after the track title.
<P>
If the CDDB server cannot determine an exact match for your CD, but
found a list of possible matches, then the user will
be prompted to select from that list.  If batch mode is active
(i.e., the -batch option is used), then no such prompt will
occur.
<P>
If the <B>offsets</B> argument is used,
then the track times are the absolute offsets from the start
of the CD.  Otherwise, the times shown are the track lengths.
<DT><I>extinfo [track#]</I><DD>
Display extended information associated with
the current CD, if available from CDDB.  If the
CD is currently playing, then extended information
associated with the playing track is also displayed.  If a
track number is used in the argument, then the extended
information of the specified track is shown instead.
<DT><I>notes [track#]</I><DD>
Display disc notes information text associated with
the current CD, if available from CDDB.  If the
CD is currently playing, then the track notes information
associated with the playing track is also displayed.  If a
track number is used in the argument, then the track notes
information text of the specified track is shown instead.
<DT><I>on-load [none | spindown | autoplay | autolock | noautolock]</I><DD>
Display, enable or disable options when a CD is loaded.  The
<I>spindown</I>

option will cause the CD to stop after loading to conserve the laser
and motor.  The
<I>autoplay</I>

option will cause the CD to automatically start playing after loading.  The
<I>autolock</I>

option causes the caddy or disc tray to be automatically locked.  The
<I>none,</I>

<I>spindown</I>

and
<I>autoplay</I>

options are mutually-exclusive.  If no argument is used, then the
current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>on-exit [none | autostop | autoeject]</I><DD>
Display, enable or disable options when the
<I>cda daemon</I>

exits.  The
<I>autostop</I>

option will cause cda to stop playback,
and the
<I>autoeject</I>

option will cause cda to eject the CD.  Use
<I>none</I>

to cancel these options.  If no argument is used, then
te current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>on-done [autoeject | noautoeject | autoexit | noautoexit]</I><DD>
Display, enable or disable options when
<I>cda</I>

is done with playback.  The
<I>autoeject</I>

option causes the
<I>cda daemon</I>

to eject the CD.  The
<I>autoexit</I>

option will cause the
<I>cda daemon</I>

to exit.  If no argument is used, then
the current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>on-eject [autoexit | noautoexit]</I><DD>
Display, enable or disable options when
<I>cda</I>

ejects a CD.  The
<I>autoexit</I>

option will cause the
<I>cda daemon</I>

to exit after ejecting the CD.  If no
argument is used, then the current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>changer [multiplay | nomultiplay | reverse | noreverse]</I><DD>
Display, enable or disable multi-disc changer options.  The
<I>multiplay</I>

option specifies that
<I>cda</I>

plays all discs in sequence.  The
<I>nomultiplay</I>

option will cause cda to stop after the current disc is done.
The
<I>reverse</I>

option implies
<I>multiplay,</I>

except that the disc order is reversed.  If no argument is used,
then the current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>mode [standard | cdda-play | cdda-save | cdda-pipe]</I><DD>
Selects the playback mode.  If no argument is used, then the
current setting is displayed.  See &quot;PLAYBACK MODES&quot; below for
details about the modes.  Please note that the cdda modes are
toggles.  If the current mode is cdda-play, specifying cdda-save
will enable both cdda-play and cdda-save modes.  Specifying a
cdda mode twice will disable that mode.  If no cdda mode is
active, then the mode will revert to standard.  Specifying standard
mode will disable all cdda modes.
<DT><I>jittercorr [on | off]</I><DD>
Enables or disables CDDA jitter correction.  If no argument is used,
then the current setting is displayed.
<DT><I>trackfile [on | off]</I><DD>
For <I>CDDA-save</I> mode, specifies whether a separate file should be
created for each CD track.  If no argument is used, then the current
setting is displayed.
<DT><I>subst [on | off]</I><DD>
For <I>CDDA-save</I> mode, specifies whether space and tab characters
in the output file path name should be substituted with underscores ('_').
This makes the files easier to manipulate while using the UNIX command shell. 
If no argument is used, then the current setting is displayed.
<DT><I>filefmt format<DD>
Specifies the output audio file format if running in cdda-save</I> or
<I>cdda-pipe</I> modes.  The <I>format</I> is one of the following:
raw, au, wav, aiff, aiff-c, mp3, ogg, flac, aac or mp4.
<DT><I>outfile [&quot;template&quot;]</I><DD>
Specifies the output audio file path name if running in <I>cdda-save</I>
mode.  If no argument is used, then the currently
defined template is displayed.  See the
<I>xmcd</I>

help file on the output file path template for information about the
special tokens that could be used in the template.
<DT><I>pipeprog [&quot;path [arg ...]&quot;]</I><DD>
Specifies the external program to which the audio stream will be piped to
when running in <I>cdda-pipe</I> mode.  If no argument is used, then the
currently defined program is displayed.
<DT><I>compress [&lt;0 | 3&gt; [bitrate#] | &lt;1 | 2&gt; [qual#]]</I><DD>
Selects the compression mode for compressed file formats, as follows:
<P>
For MP3, the modes are as follows:
<PRE>
0       Constant bitrate (CBR)
1       Variable bitrate (VBR, old algorithm)
2       Variable bitrate (VBR, new algorithm, faster)
3       Average bit rate (ABR)
</PRE>

<P>
For Ogg Vorbis and MP4, all modes are VBR, as follows:
<PRE>
0, 3    Use an average bit rate
1, 2    Use a quality factor
</PRE>

<P>
For FLAC, the modes are as follows:
<PRE>
0       None
1       Enable exhaustive LP coefficient quant. search
2       Enable encoding correctness verification
3       Enable both
</PRE>

<P>
For AAC, all modes are VBR, as follows:
<PRE>
0       Use an average bit rate, MPEG-2
1       Use a quality factor, MPEG-2
2       Use a quality factor, MPEG-4
3       Use an average bit rate, MPEG-4
</PRE>

<P>
For modes <I>0</I> and <I>3</I>, an optional bitrate (in kb/s)
sub-argument can be specified.  The supported bitrates are a discrete
set of numbers from 32 to 320.  A value of 0 can also be used to indicate
the use of an internal default.  For modes <I>1</I> and <I>2</I>, an optional
quality factor (from 1 to 10) sub-argument can be used.
Lower bitrates and quality factor values yield smaller
files whereas higher numbers produce higher audio quality.
For AAC and MP4 formats, the bitrate you specify will be double the
actual bitrate (e.g., if you specify 128kbps, the actual bitrate used
will be 64kbps).  The bitrate or quality values, if specified, are
ignored for the FLAC format.  If no argument is used, then the current
settings are displayed.
<DT><I>min-brate [bitrate#]</I><DD>
In average bitrate and variable bitrate modes, this commands lets you
specify a low bitrate limit.  The encoder will not drop below this limit
while dynamically changing the bitrate.  A value of 0 can be specified
to indicate the use of an internal default.
If no argument is used, then the current setting is displayed.
This parameter has no effect on the FLAC, AAC or MP4 format.
<DT><I>max-brate [bitrate#]</I><DD>
In average bitrate and variable bitrate modes, this commands lets you
specify a high bitrate limit.  The encoder will not go above this limit
while dynamically changing the bitrate.  A value of 0 can be specified
to indicate the use of an internal default.
If no argument is used, then the current setting is displayed.
This parameter has no effect on the FLAC, AAC or MP4 format.
<DT><I>coding [stereo | j-stereo | force-ms | mono | algo#&gt;]fR<DD>
This command selects the stereo mode and encoding
noise-shaping/psychoacoustics algorithm.
If no argument is used, then the current settings are displayed.
<P>
For MP3, the algorithm is a number from 1 to 10.  Lower numbers gives
faster encoding whereas higher numbers produce higher audio quality.
<P>
For AAC and MP4, stereo</I> disables the mid/side coding,
<I>j-stereo</I> and <I>force-ms</I> are synonymous, and <I>mono</I>
is not supported.  An algorithm value of 10 enables
temporal noise shaping (TNS).
<P>
For FLAC, the stereo modes have no effect, but the algorithm value
selects between faster encoding versus slightly better compression.
<P>
For Ogg Vorbis, this parameter has no effect.
<DT><I>lowpass [off | auto | freq# [width#]]</I><DD>
This allows a lowpass filter to be added.
The <I>off</I> setting means no filter, the <I>auto</I> setting causes the
encoder to determine whether a filter should be added and its parameters.
Specifying a frequency (and optionally, a width) will enable the filter
in manual mode.  The frequency and width are both in Hz.
The valid frequency range is from 16 to 50000 Hz.
For MP3, the filter functions fully as described.
For AAC and MP4, the <I>freq</I> can be used to limit the bandwidth,
but the <I>width</I> is ignored.
For Ogg Vorbis and FLAC, these parameters have no effect.
If no argument is used, then the current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>highpass [off | auto | freq# [width#]]</I><DD>
For encoding to MP3 files, this allows a highpass filter to be added.
The <I>off</I> setting means no filter, the <I>auto</I> setting causes the
encoder to determine whether a filter should be added and its parameters.
Specifying a frequency (and optionally, a width) will enable the filter
in manual mode.  The frequency and width are both in Hz.
The valid frequency range is from 500 to 50000 Hz.  The lower limit
is imposed by the polyphase filter implementation in the MP3 encoder.
For non-MP3 formats, these parameters have no effect.
If no argument is used, then the current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>flags [C|c][O|o][N|n][E|e][I|i]</I><DD>
This allows you to specify some MP3 header and frame flags.
The letter <I>c</I> denotes the &quot;copyright&quot; flag, the letter <I>o</I>
denotes the &quot;original&quot; flag, the letter <I>n</I> denotes the &quot;no res&quot;
(no bit reservoir) flag, the letter <I>e</I> denotes the addition of a
2-byte checksum to each frame for error correction, and the letter
<I>i</I> indicates strict ISO compatibility.  The use of a upper-case
letter turns on the flag, and lower-case turns off the flag.  Multiple
flags may be specified together.  If no argument is used, then the current
settings are displayed.
<DT><I>lameopts [&lt;disable | insert | append | replace&gt; [&quot;options&quot;]]</I><DD>
This command allows you to query or set command line options to
be passed directly to the LAME MP3 encoder, and control how those
options will be passed.  This facilitates the use of advanced or
experimental LAME features that cannot otherwise be invoked via the
<I>cda</I>

command line interface for setting encoding parameters.
The following keywords control how the command line options
are to be passed:
<P>
<I>disable</I>: No additional command line options are to be passed.
<BR>

<I>insert</I>: The specified options are to be inserted before
the standard options.
<BR>

<I>append</I>: The specified options are to be appended after
the standard options.
<BR>

<I>replace</I>: The specified options are to be used instead of
the standard options.
<P>
Standard options refers to the LAME command line options that
<I>cda</I>

generates, based on the current settings (and can be altered by
other encoding related cda commands above).
If no argument is used, then the current settings are displayed.
<DT><I>tag [off | v1 | v2 | both]</I><DD>
This command specifies whether CD information (such as album and track
artists and titles, genre type, etc.) should be added to the CDDA output
file.  For MP3, the information is added to either the version 1, version 2
or both versions of the ID3 tag areas.  For Ogg Vorbis, FLAC and MP4,
the information is added to the metadata area.
<BR>

Note: An ID3v2 tag will not be added to the
<I>cdda-pipe</I>

MP3 stream regardless of the setting of this command.
<DT><I>device</I><DD>
Displays the CD drive and device information.
<DT><I>version</I><DD>
Displays the
<I>cda</I>

version and copyright information.
<DT><I>cddbreg</I><DD>
Invoke dialog to register with Gracenote in order to access the CDDB<SUP>2</SUP> service.
This command can be used to do the initial registration, as well as to
change or update user registration information.  This function is not
available with the &quot;classic&quot; CDDB service.
<DT><I>cddbhint</I><DD>
Ask Gracenote to send the password hint via e-mail.  This is used in case you
forget the CDDB user password.  The password and password hint are both
initially set via the <I>cddbreg</I> command.  This function is not
available with the &quot;classic&quot; CDDB service.
<DT><I>motd</I><DD>
Retrieve and display messages from the xmcd MOTD server, if any.
Note that messages are displayed by the
<I>cda</I>

daemon rather than the client process.  Thus, it will be displayed
on the terminal where the daemon was started.
<DT><I>debug [level#]</I><DD>
Show, or set the debug level.  If set, verbose debugging
diagnostics will be printed on <I>stderr</I> of the terminal
that the
<I>cda daemon</I>

is started from.  If this is the same terminal that is running
<I>cda</I>

in visual mode, the debug information will corrupt the screen.
See the description of the <I>-debug</I> option above for supported
debug levels.

<P>

<B>WARNING:</B>

If
<I>cda</I>

is not correctly configured, you may cause
<I>cda</I>

to deliver commands that are not supported by your CD drive.
Under some environments this may lead to system hang or crash.

<H3>USING CDA</H3>
<DIR>

Start the
<I>cda daemon</I>

with the <B>cda on</B> command (or the F1 (o) function in visual mode).
This reserves the CD device and initializes the program for
further commands.  All other
<I>cda</I>

functions will not work unless the
<I>cda daemon</I>

is running.
The other
<I>cda</I>

commands should be self explanatory.
<P>

The <B>off</B> command (or the F1 (o) function in visual mode)
can be used to terminate the
<I>cda daemon</I>

and release the CD drive for use by other software.
<P>

</DIR>
<A NAME="VISUAL_MODE" id="VISUAL_MODE">&nbsp;</A><A NAME="lbAI" id="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>VISUAL MODE</H3>
<DIR>

If the
<I>cda visual</I>

command is used, it enters a screen-oriented visual mode.
In this mode, the status and other information available
is continuously displayed and updated on the screen, and
most functions are available via a single key stroke.
<P>

The minimum terminal screen size for the visual mode is 80 columns by
9 rows.  If your terminal is made to be smaller than that (for example,
an <B>xterm</B>(1) window that has been sized too small), the
output will be garbled.  For best results, an 80x24 or larger terminal
screen should be used.
<P>

Visual mode uses the curses screen library to control the screen.
It is essential that the TERM environment variable reflect the current
terminal type, which ideally should have 8 (or more) function keys.
Since function key definitions in terminfo descriptions are often
unreliable, alphabetic key alternatives are also available.
<P>

The screen is divided into two windows: an information window and a
status window.  According to context, the information window displays
a help screen, device and version information, disc information and
table of contents, or extended information about the track.  This window is
scrollable if it overflows its allotted screen area.
The status window consists of the last few lines of the screen,
enclosed in a box.  The first line contains the program list, or
track number and offset together with volume, balance and stereo/mono
information.  The remaining lines contain the function keys
(with their alphabetic synonymns) and the functions they invoke.
These functions are highlighted when they are on, making
it easy to see the current state.
<P>

Screen annotation and online help make operation self explanatory,
but for reference, a list of commands follows. Alphabetic key
alternatives to function keys are given in parenthesis.

<H3>CD DATABASE</H3>
<DIR>

The Gracenote CDDB&reg; Music Recognition Service(sm) feature is supported by
<I>cda,</I>

which allows you to display the disc artists/title,
track titles, and other information about the CD
or tracks via the <B>toc</B>, <B>extinfo</B> and <B>notes</B> commands of
<I>cda.</I>

In visual mode, this information is displayed automatically
if available.  You cannot add, modify or submit CDDB information via
<I>cda.</I>

For more details about CDDB, see <B><A HREF="xmcd.html">xmcd</A></B>(1)
and the CDDB file that comes with this release.
<P>

This release of
<I>cda</I>

also supports reading the CD-TEXT data from the disc for
CD information.  Only some recent CDs are produced with CD-TEXT
data and this data can only be read on CD drives with CD-TEXT
capability.
<P>

The priority of the CD information schemes (CDDB, CD-TEXT or local CD
database files) is controlled via the cdinfoPath parameter in the
<B>common.cfg</B> file.

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>standard</I><DD>
<BR>

When playing an audio CD, the audio output is the analog &quot;line out&quot;
connection on the back of your CD drive.  There should be an audio
cable connecting this output to your computer audio hardware CD
input (or to an externally amplfied speaker or stereo system).  The
audio output is also available at the CD drive's front panel
headphone connection, if so equipped.  The
<I>cda</I>

<B>volume</B>
command affect the CD drive's built-in volume control, if the drive
has such controls.  This is the mode that previous releases
(<I>cda</I> version 1.x through 3.0) supported.
<P>
<DT><I>cdda-play</I><DD>
<BR>

When playing a CD in this mode,
<I>cda</I>

extracts the CD digital audio data off the CD drive over the
data cable (e.g., SCSI or ATAPI/IDE).  Then, it sends the data to the
DSP (digital signal processor) device in your computer's audio hardware
for real-time playback.  The audio is typically heard through the
computer's built-in speakers.  No signal is produced at the line-out
or headphone connections of the CD drive.  The
<I>cda</I>

<B>volume</B>
command affects the computer's DSP device.
<P>
<DT><I>cdda-save</I><DD>
<BR>

When playing a CD in this mode,
<I>cda</I>

extracts the CD digital audio data off the CD drive over the
data cable (e.g., SCSI or ATAPI/IDE).  Then, it writes the data
into a file of your choosing.  The
<I>cda</I>

<B>volume</B>
command does not affect the data written to
the output file.  The output file format can be selected to be one
of the following:
<P>
<PRE>
Format Ext   Description
------ ----- ---------------------------------------
RAW    .raw  Little-endian, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo
AU     .au   Big-endian, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo
WAV    .wav  Little-endian, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo
AIFF   .aiff Big-endian, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo
AIFF-C .aifc Big-endian, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo
MP3    .mp3  MPEG 1.0 Layer III compressed
OGG    .ogg  Ogg Vorbis compressed
FLAC   .flac Free Lossless Audio CODEC compressed
AAC    .aac  AAC (MPEG-2 or MPEG-4) compressed
MP4    .mp4  MP4 (MPEG-4) compressed
</PRE>

<P>
The file can be played later using an appropriate playback utility,
or converted to another format.  This mode will typically run faster than
real-time with the non-compressed formats.  With the compressed formats,
it depends on the CPU performance of your system.
<P>
<DT><I>cdda-pipe</I><DD>
<BR>

When playing a CD in this mode,
<I>cda</I>

extracts the CD digital audio data off the CD drive over the
data cable (e.g., SCSI or ATAPI/IDE).  Then, it pipes the data
stream to an external program that you specify.  The output
format is selected as in the <I>CDDA save to file</I> mode.
This mode can be used with an external audio player, encoder, or
other digital audio manipulation program.
The external program must be capable of accepting audio data on its
standard input, in one of the formats listed above.
</DL>
<P>

More than one of the three CDDA modes can be selected at the same time.
For example, if both the <I>cdda-play</I> and the
<I>cdda-save</I> modes are enabled, the two functions
will be performed simultaneously.  Note that on most systems, only one
program can access the system's DSP at a time, therefore you will
likely not be able to select <I>cdda-play</I> and
<I>cdda-pipe</I> at the same time, where the external program
is itself an audio player.
<P>

<B>NOTE</B>: The CDDA (CD digital audio) modes will function only on
CD drives that provides this capability, and only on some OS and
hardware platforms.  See the RELNOTES file for details about platform
support and other CDDA related notes.

<A NAME="LOCALIZATION" id="LOCALIZATION">&nbsp;</A><A NAME="lbAL" id="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>LOCALIZATION</H3>
<DIR>

The &quot;classic&quot; CDDB service supplies data in the ISO Latin-1 format only,
multi-byte characters are not supported.
<P>

The CDDB<SUP>2</SUP> service supplies data in UTF-8 data format, which is
identical to US-ASCII for single-byte characters.  Multi-byte UTF-8
characters are also supported.
By default, cda will translate the characters to ISO Latin-1
(ISO 8859-1, for English and many European character sets).
By changing the setting of the <B>charsetConvMode</B> parameter in
the <B>common.cfg</B> file, you can have
<I>cda</I>

display the UTF-8 data without conversion (good for US-ASCII
or if you are using UTF-8 fonts),
or attempt to convert UTF-8 strings to the default character set
as specified by the <B>LANG</B> environment variable.  This conversion
will occur only if the system's list of locales also support UTF-8.
<P>

If you desire to view CDDB data in languages other than English or the
ISO Latin-1 European character set, you may need to configure
your display terminal to display the appropriate fonts (if the
terminal has such capabilities).  Terminal font configuration is
device-dependent, OS-dependent and beyond the scope of this document.
Please see your display terminal's documentation (or in the case of
a computer graphics console, the operating system's console font
related documentation for information.
<P>

Non-CDDB text (such as headings, labels and error messages) are not
localized in
<I>cda.</I>

<H3>NOTES</H3>
<DIR>

Not all platforms and CD drives support all the features of
<I>cda.</I>

For example, some drives do not support a software-driven
volume control.  On these drives the
<I>cda</I>

<B>volume</B> and <B>balance</B> commands may have no effect, or may
simply change the volume between full mute and maximum.
Similarly, the <B>lock</B>, <B>disc</B>, <B>index</B>,
and <B>route</B> commands of
<I>cda</I>

may not have any effect on drives that
do not support the appropriate functionality.
<P>

The lame(1) MP3 encoder program must be installed on your system in
order for
<I>cda</I>

to perform CD ripping to MP3 format files.  Similarly, the
faac(1) encoder program must be installed on your system for
the AAC and MP4 formats.
<P>

Your copy of the
<I>cda</I>

executable must be compiled and linked with the Ogg Vorbis and FLAC encoder
libraries in order to perform CD ripping to these formats.  See the
INSTALL file for details.
<P>

</DIR>
<A NAME="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">&nbsp;</A><A NAME="lbAN" id="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H3>
<DIR>

The <B>LANG</B> environment variable sets the default character set.
See &quot;LOCALIZATION&quot; above.
<P>

The <B>LAME_PATH</B> environment variable may be used to specify the
path to the lame(1) MP3 encoder program.
<P>

The <B>FAAC_PATH</B> environment variable may be used to specify the
path to the faac(1) AAC/MP4 encoder program.
<P>

The <B>AUDIODEV</B> environment variable may be used to specify an
alternate audio device when running
<I>cda</I>

in the <I>cdda-play</I> mode.
The default audio device is write method dependent as follows:

<PRE>

AIX write method:       /dev/paud0/1    (PCI audio)
AIX write method:       /dev/baud0/1    (MCA audio)
ALSA write method:      plughw:0,0
HP-UX write method:     /dev/audio
Linux/OSS write method: /dev/dsp
OSF1 write method:      0
Solaris write method:   /dev/audio
</PRE>

<P>

In addition, with the OSS and ALSA write methods, the <B>MIXERDEV</B>
environment variable may be used to specify the PCM mixer channel device.
The default is <I>/dev/mixer</I> for OSS, and <I>default</I> for ALSA.
<P>

On FreeBSD with ATAPI CD drives, cda will automatically use either
the CDIOCREADAUDIO ioctl or the pread(2) system call for CDDA reads,
based on the running kernel version.  You may override the default
by setting the environment variable <B>CDDA_USE_PREAD</B> to 0 or 1,
respectively.  Normally this is not necessary.
