CDDB "classic" library for xmcd
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains source files for libcddb, which is a partial
implementation of the Gracenote CDDB API for UNIX.  Internally this
library uses the "classic" CDDB servers/protocol and therefore provides
only a subset of the newer CDDB features.

This is the default CDDB library included with the xmcd/cda source
code distribution.  For those OS and platforms that an official
Gracenote CDDB library is available, a CDDB support kit can be
downloaded from the official xmcd web site.  See the docs_d/INSTALL
and docs_d/CDDB files for details.

For the official xmcd/cda pre-compiled binary distributions, the
Gracenote CDDB library is used if it is available for your OS and
platform.  Otherwise, the xmcd/cda executables are statically
linked with this library.

Note that this library is compiled in archive (.a) form, while the
official Gracenote CDDB library is likely to be a shared library (.so).
This means that once an xmcd/cda executable is linked to use this
library, it will not use the Gracenote CDDB shared library unless it is
re-linked to dynamically use the latter.

This library only implements a subset of the CDDB API, enough to
support xmcd/cda, but not enough to be a general purpose substitute for
Gracenote's CDDB library.  This means that attempts at linking this
library with other CDDB-enabled applications would probably fail.

Since xmcd/cda's use of the CDDB API may change from version to
version, this library is matched and supplied with each xmcd/cda
release.

The author of xmcd/cda <xmcd@amb.org> provides support for this library.
However, please contact Gracenote <support@gracenote.com> for all issues
with their official CDDB library.
