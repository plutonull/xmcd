WORLD WIDE WEB SITES 
--------------------

If your system has the Netscape, Mozilla, Galeon or Opera browser
installed, you can access all of the below web sites directly via the
wwwWarp feature of xmcd.  Just click the wwwWarp button on the xmcd
main window.

The xmcd/cda web site is at:

    http://www.amb.org/xmcd/

This site provides up-to-date information about the current release
version, features list, Frequently Asked Questions (and answers),
and late breaking announcement, if any.

The source code bundle and pre-compiled binary releases of xmcd/cda
for certain OS environments are also available from this site.

The Gracenote CDDB(R) web page is at:

    http://www.cddb.com/

This site is the home of CDDB, the largest music information database.
You may use the CDDB search engine to look for a CD, peruse CDDB's
Top-Ten chart and other music news, and much more.  Note that Netscape
browsers 4.x and earlier may not display the Gracenote pages properly.
If you're running old Netscape browsers, please update to the latest
version, or switch to using one of the other supported browsers.

The xmcd wwwWarp feature also lets you perform searches on Internet
search engine sites, so you can browse discographies, music reviews,
lyrics, fan club and concert information, art and graphics, and many
other sites related to the CD or track that you're listening to.  This
enhances your CD playing experience and is as simple as a few mouse
clicks.

Xmcd comes pre-configured with a list of wwwWarp Internet search sites
for your convenience.  However, this does not imply any affiliation of
xmcd and its author with these sites, nor does it imply any endorsement
or guarantee of their contents or services.

A search site may change its CGI interface in the future.  If that
occurs, the format of the search request that xmcd sends may no longer
work on that particular site.  The search URLs are configured via the
XMCDLIB/config/wwwwarp.cfg file (and you can override the file with
your own $HOME/.xmcdcfg/wwwwarp.cfg file).

In addition to Internet sites, wwwWarp comes pre-configured with a
"Local Discography" selection which lets you use xmcd and the web
browser to view, play and print local documents (text files, HTML,
images, sound files, movies, etc.) that are related to the CD that is
loaded in the drive.  You may deposit these files under the
DISCOGRAPHY/%C/%I directory (where DISCOGRAPHY is typically
XMCDLIB/discog, %C is the CDDB genre directory name and %I is the
xmcd 8-digit disc ID).  For example:

	/usr/lib/X11/xmcd/discog/Rock/General_Rock/ef107e0f

This directory and an index.html file are created automatically by xmcd
when you select Local Discography.  You can store additional files
in it, and use wwwWarp to access them.  Your web browser may require
special plug-ins to support viewing/playing certain file formats.
See the Links section of the xmcd web site for pointers to a free
UNIX Netscape streaming mutimedia plug-in package.

Please be aware of possible legal implications when sharing
music-related files with others.  Some of the information, including
album cover art, graphics and photos, lyrics and other data are likely
to be protected by copyright.  Xmcd and its author are not liable for
the users' actions.

By default, xmcd will search your system for a supported web browser
and use the first one found.  If you have multiple web browsers installed,
you may specify the browser to use by setting the BROWSER_PATH environment
variable.  For example, if you wish to use the /usr/local/bin/galeon
browser, do the following.

For sh, ksh or bash users, add the following to your $HOME/.profile or
$HOME/.bashrc file:

	BROWSER_PATH=/usr/local/bin/galeon; export BROWSER_PATH

For csh or tcsh users, add the following to your $HOME/.cshrc file:

	setenv BROWSER_PATH /usr/local/bin/galeon

Log in again to have this change take effect.
