Xmcd uses the Motif toolkit to achieve a pleasing appearance, such that
it actually looks and feels like a real CD player for all basic
functions, yet takes advantage of the GUI and window system to make
programming and CD database functions easy. 

Currently, the cda utility offers almost the same functionality as xmcd
except the FF, REW, Sample, A->B and wwwWarp features are not available.
Also, the CD information capability is read-only via cda (no updates).
In addition, a visual mode is available that turns cda into a screen-
oriented (curses-based) CD player.
