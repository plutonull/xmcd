! For CDDA playback mode, this selects the audio output port(s).  The
! value is the sum of the following:
!
! 1	Computer internal speaker
! 2	Headphone jack on the computer
! 4	Line out on the computer
!
! When set to 0, the setting is unmodified and can be controlled via an
! external audio control utility (usually supplied by the OS vendor).
! This parameter may only be meaningful on some platforms, and only certain
! ports may be available on a particular architecture.
!
outputPort:		0

! Local CD information file permissions (used for xmcd "Local Discography")
! (xmcd only)
!
cdinfoFileMode:		0666

! Whether internet access should be inhibited.  If this is set to True,
! CD information lookups will only be done from the local cache (No remote
! CDDB server access).  Also, in xmcd, all wwwWarp menu entries that would
! invoke a remote web site will be disabled.
!
internetOffline:	False

! CD information search path.  This is a similar to the functionality
! of the "cddbPath" parameter found in xmcd 1.x and 2.x.  Items are
! separated by a semi-colon ';' character.  Each item can be:
!	- The keyword "CDDB", which indicates that the CDDB(R) MRS(sm)
!	  service will be used to obtain the CD information over the internet.
!	  This may use the "classic" CDDB service or the enhanced CDDB2
!	  service, depending on which library the xmcd/cda executables are
!	  linked with.
!	- The keyword "CDTEXT", which indicates that xmcd/cda shall attempt
!	  to read CD-TEXT data from the CD itself.  Only some drives
!	  support CD-TEXT and only some CDs contains this information.
!	  This keyword will be ignored if the device-specific cdTextDisable
!	  parameter is set to True.
!	- An absolute directory path.  Tilde expansion '~' is supported.
!	  Examples:
!		/usr/local/lib/cddb/classical
!		~john/cddb/jazz
!		~/mycddb/rock
!	- A relative directory path (which is taken to be relative
!	  to the top-level local CD database directory)
!	  Examples:
!		blues
!		reggae
!		soundtrack
!
! If the directory name is a "classic" CDDB standard genre, xmcd/cda will
! automatically translate it into an equivalent CDDB2 genre on screen.
!
! NOTE:	"Classic" CDDB remote database server URL entries are no longer
!	supported in this parameter.
!
cdinfoPath:		CDDB;rock;jazz;blues;newage;classical;reggae;folk;country;soundtrack;misc;unclass;data;CDTEXT

! Method of conversion between the UTF-8 CDDB data and the local
! character set.  The legal values are:
!
! 0	No conversion is performed.  This will work for plain US-ASCII
!	CDDB data, as well as non-ASCII data if UTF-8 fonts are used.
!
! 1	Convert UTF-8 data to ISO 8859-1.  This will work for US-ASCII
!	as well as many European languages.  ISO 8859-1 fonts should
!	be used to display the data correctly.
!
! 2	Convert UTF-8 data to the local character set using iconv(3).
!	This is based on the user's LANG environment setting.  Note
!	that not all OS platforms support iconv(3), or the character
!	set information may not be available.  In such an event, the
!	conversion falls back to ISO 8859-1.
!
charsetConvMode:	1

! The name string for the UTF-8 character set encoding.  This is used
! as input to the iconv_open(3) function for character set conversion
! when the charsetConvMode parameter is set to 2.
!
langUtf8:		UTF-8

! If a CDDB lookup yields only one inexact "fuzzy" match, setting this
! parameter to True will cause xmcd/cda to simply accept the match.
! Otherwise, a dialog box will appear to let you choose whether to
! accept it or not.
!
acceptSingleFuzzy:	False

! Whether to use a proxy server when connecting to CDDB
!
cddbUseProxy:		False

! The proxy server's host name and port number.  This is used
! only when cddbUseProxy is set to True.
!

!
! The host name can also be an IP number.  The port number is optional
! (default is 80).
!
!	Examples:
!		proxy.xyz.com
!		proxy.xyz.com:80
!
proxyServer:		yourproxyhost:80

! Whether your proxy server enforces user password authorization
! (i.e., a user name and password pair must be entered to gain access
! through the proxy).  This is used only when cddbUseProxy is set to
! True.
!

! Whether xmcd will automatically send your web browser to the
! CDDB Music Browser on each successful lookup from CDDB.  This
! feature is available only when using the CDDB2 service.
!
autoMusicBrowser:	True

! The number days after which a locally-cached CDDB record would expire.
! After expiration, xmcd/cda will query the information from the
! server again.
!
cddbCacheTimeout:	7

! The amount of time (in seconds) allowed to establish network
! connections, interprocess communication or invoking external commands.
! If the task being invoked does not complete successfully within this

! If no disc, poll interval for disc insertion (msec).  This is
! used only if "insertPollDisable" is False.  The minimum is 500.
! (xmcd only)
!
insertPollInterval:	4000

! If set to True, this causes xmcd not to poll for disc insertion
! when xmcd is first started (and a CD is not loaded), or after a
! CD is ejected.  A CD is detected only when the "Play/Pause" or
! "Stop" button is clicked.
! (xmcd only)
!
insertPollDisable:	False

! When previous track/index button pressed, if this number of audio blocks
! has been played in the current track/index, then playback will start from

! Whether Sun Solaris Volume Manager (vold) is running.  This is used
! only on the Solaris platform with the Volume Manager.
!
solaris2VolumeManager:	False

! Whether error messages are output to stderr when xmcd encounters
! errors when delivering commands to the CD drive.  You should only
! set this to False if you have a non SCSI-2 compliant CD drive that
! causes xmcd to display lots of error messages.
!
showScsiErrMsg:		True

! Whether the current device, disc ID, category and other information
! should be recorded in the /tmp/.cdaudio/curr.XXX file

! 5	Disc remaining time (r-disc)
! (xmcd only)
!
timeDisplayMode:	0

! Whether to enable tool-tips.  When enabled, if the mouse cursor is
! positioned over a main window control, a small window appears after
! a short delay, describing the function of the control.
! (xmcd only)
!
tooltipEnable:		True

! If tooltipEnable is set to True, this is the time delay (msec) after
! the mouse is positioned over a control before the tool-tip is popped up.
! (xmcd only)
!
tooltipDelayInterval:	1000

! After a tool-tip is popped up, the minimum amount of time (msec) that
! the tooltip will be displayed before disappearing.  The actual amount
! of time will be scaled up based on the length of text in the tool-tip.
! Setting this to zero will make the tooltip stay active until the mouse
! cursor is moved away from the control.
! (xmcd only)
!
tooltipActiveInterval:	3000

! Whether xmcd/cda should disable maintaining a per-user history file of
! CDs that were played as $HOME/.xmcdcfg/history.  If set to True, then
! no history file will be written.
!
historyFileDisable:	False

! The maximum number of disc entries to maintain in the per-user history.
! If the history grows to beyond this number, old history is automatcally
! cleaned to maintain this count.  This is to limit the history file
! size and memory consumption.  If this is set to 0, then no history will
! be kept.
!
maximumHistory:		100

! The per-user history file's permissions
!
historyFileMode:	0600

! Whether the remote control feature should be enabled.
! (xmcd only)
!

! remoteControlEnable parameter is also True.
! (xmcd only)
!
remoteControlLog:	True

! When running in CDDA save-to-file mode, whether to write a separate
! file for each CD track.  This parameter is the start-up default,
! and can be changed via the user-interface.
!
cddaFilePerTrack:	True

! When running in CDDA save-to-file mode, whether to substitute all
! spaces and tabs in the output file path name with the underscore '_'
! character.  This makes the file names more shell-friendly.
!
cddaSpaceToUnderscore:	True

! When running in CDDA save-to-file or CDDA pipe-to-program modes, the
! file format to output the audio data in.  This parameter is the start-up
! default, and can be changed via the user-interface.
!
! Valid values are:

!
! "Reduced" means all punctuation deleted, and any words in the excludeWords
! list are also excluded.
!
! Note:	If the template contains the %R, %r, %T, %t or %# tokens, the
!	cddaFilePerTrack parameter will automatically be enabled.  Also,
!	if a file type suffix (e.g., ".wav") is specified and does not
!	match the type specified with the cddaFileFormat parameter, the
!	cddaFileFormat takes precedence.
!
cddaFileTemplate:	-

! The CDDA pipe-to-program path and arguments.  A single dash '-' character
! denotes that no program is specified.
!
cddaPipeProgram:	-

! CDDA mode process scheduling option, as follows:
! 0	Normal extraction and playback scheduling priority
! 1	High extraction scheduling priority
! 2	High playback scheduling priority
! 3	High extraction and playback scheduling priority
!
! Note:	The meaning of "High scheduling priority" is platform dependent.
!	This parameter may not have an effect if xmcd/cda is not run with
!       the appropriate privilege.
!
cddaSchedOptions:	0

! This is the CDDA extraction/playback thread heartbeat timeout interval
! in seconds.
!
! To detect a crash or hang error condition in the CDDA extraction and
! playback threads, these threads produce periodic "heartbeat" timestamps
! that are monitored by the main control thread.  When the extraction or
! playback thread has not produced a heartbeat longer than the time interval
! defined by this parameter, the control thread will consider it an error
! and terminate the CDDA operation.
! 
! This parameter may need to be increased when run on a very slow system,
! in order to avoid a false termination of the CDDA operation.
! 
! The minimum heartbeat timeout value is 5 seconds and the default is 15
! seconds.
!
cddaHeartbeatTimeout:	15

! CDDA output file/stream compression mode.
! This parameter selects format-specific compression modes.
!

! 0	Constant bitrate (CBR)
! 1	Variable bitrate (VBR, old algorithm)
! 2	Variable bitrate (VBR, new algorithm, faster)
! 3	Average bit rate (ABR)
!
! For Ogg Vorbis and MP4, all modes are VBR, as follows:
! 0, 3	Use an average bit rate
! 1, 2	Use a quality factor
!
! For FLAC, the modes are as follows:
! 0	None
! 1	Enable exhaustive LP coefficient quantization search
! 2	Enable encoding correctness verification
! 3	Enable both 1 and 2
!
! For AAC, all modes are VBR, as follows:
! 0	Use an average bit rate, MPEG-2
! 1	Use a quality factor, MPEG-2
! 2	Use a quality factor, MPEG-4
! 3	Use an average bit rate, MPEG-4
!
! At the same bitrate or quality factor, there is no sound quality
! difference between MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, but some players support only
! one of these versions.
!
compressionMode:	2

! CBR or ABR compression bitrate in kb/s.  The valid values are:
! 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 or 320
! Furthermore, the value 0 can be used to denote "default bitrate".
!
! Note: Not used for FLAC.
!
compressionBitrate:	128

! Minimum and maximum bitrates in kb/s.  Only used when the compression
! mode is not CBR.  The valid values are:

! Furthermore, the value 0 can be specified to use an internal default.
! If the value is not 0, it must satisfy the following relationship:
!
!	minimumBitrate <= compressionBitrate <= maximumBitrate
!
! Note: Only used for MP3 and Ogg Vorbis.
!
minimumBitrate:		80
maximumBitrate:		256

! VBR quality factor (valid range 1 to 10).  Only used
! when compressionMode is set to a VBR setting.
!
! Note: Not used for FLAC.
!
compressionQuality:	3

! Output file channel mode, as follows:
! 0	Stereo		(most separation)
! 1	Joint-stereo	(optimized compression)
! 2	Forced mid/side	(faster)
! 3	Mono		(down-mixed)
!
! Notes:
! - For MP3, all modes are as described above.
! - For AAC and MP4, setting to mode 0 disables mid/side coding.
!   Modes 1 and 2 are identical, and mode 3 is not supported.
! - For all other formats, these modes have no effect.
!
channelMode:		1

! Noise-shaping and psycho-acoustics encoding algorithm tuning.
! This can be set from 1 to 10.
!
! Notes:
! - For MP3, a setting of 10 provides the best audio quality, whereas a
!   setting of 1 gives the fastest encoding.
! - For Ogg Vorbis, this parameter has no effect.
! - For FLAC, a setting of 10 gives the best compression, whereas a
!   setting of 1 gives the fastest encoding.  There is no audio quality
!   consequence in any setting.
! - For AAC and MP4, if the parameter is set to 10, temporal noise
!   shaping (TNS) will be enabled.  All other settings disables TNS.
!
compressionAlgorithm:	4

! Lowpass filter mode, as follows:
! 0	Filter off	(filter disabled)
! 1	Filter auto	(encoder decides)
! 2	Filter manual	(filter enabled, user-specified freq/width) 
!
! Note: This filter has no effect for Ogg Vorbis or FLAC.
!
lowpassMode:		0

! Lowpass filter frequency in Hz.  Valid range is 16 to 50000.
! This parameter is used only when lowpassMode is 2.
!
lowpassFrequency:	20000

! Lowpass filter width in Hz.  Valid range is a value equal to or
! greater than 0.  A value of 0 uses an internal default (15% of the
! lowpassFrequency).  This parameter is used only when lowpassMode is 2.
!
! Note: This parameter is only used with MP3.
!
lowpassWidth:		0

! Highpass filter mode, as follows:
! 0	Filter off	(filter disabled)
! 1	Filter auto	(encoder decides)
! 2	Filter manual	(filter enabled, user-specified freq/width) 
!
! Note: This filter only has an effect with MP3.
!
highpassMode:		0

! Highpass filter frequency in Hz.  Valid range is 500 to 50000.
! The lower limit is imposed by the polyphase filter implementation in
! the MP3 encoder.  This parameter is used only when highpassMode is 2.
!
highpassFrequency:	500

! Highpass filter width in Hz.  Valid range is a value equal to or
! greater than 0.  A value of 0 uses an internal default (15% of the

!
highpassWidth:		0

! MP3 copyright flag.  When set to True, the "copyrighted" flag in the
! audio header is set.
!
copyrightFlag:		False

! MP3 original flag.  When set to True, the "original" flag in the
! audio header is set.
!
originalFlag:		True

! MP3 no bit reservoir flag.  When set to True, the bit reservoir is
! disabled.  Each audio frame will be independent from previous one,
! but the quality will be lower.
!
noBitReservoirFlag:	False

! MP3 checksum flag.  When set to True, a 2-byte checksum is used in each
! frame for error correction.  This would degrade quality slightly because
! it uses bits that would otherwise be used for encoding.
!
checksumFlag:		False

! MP3 strict ISO compliance.  When set to True, the 7680 bit limitation on
! total frame size will be enforced.  This results in wasted bits for high
! bitrate encodings but will ensure strict ISO compatibility.  May be
! needed for some hardware players.
!
strictISO:		False

! Add CD information tag.  If set to True, the CD information (such as
! album, artist, title, year, etc.,) will be embedded in the output file.
! This information can be displayed by players that support this feature.
!
! Notes:
! - For MP3, the CD information is stored in the ID3 tag.
! - For Ogg Vorbis, the CD information is stored in the comment field.
! - For FLAC, the CD information is stored in a Vorbis comment metadata block.
! - For MP4, the CD information is stored in the metadata area.  Note that
!   MP4 tagging is implemented only in FAAC 1.24.x.
! - For all other formats, tagging is currently not implemented.
!
addInfoTag:		True

! MP3 ID3 tag version selection, as follows:
! 1	Add ID3 v1 tag only
! 2	Add ID3 v2 tag only
! 3	Add both ID3 v1 and v2 tags
!
! Note: Some players recognize only one of these tag versions.
!
id3TagMode:		3

! Specify how the command line options as indicated in the lameOptions
! parameter should be applied.
! 0	Disabled
! 1	Insert before the standard options
! 2	Append after the standard options
! 3	Replace the standard options
!
! "Standard options" refers to the encoding-related LAME command line
! options that are normally generated by xmcd (from the settings of
! the graphical user interface) or cda (from the command line arguments).
!
! Note: Xmcd/cda will still pass tagging-related command line options
! to LAME if the addInfoTags parameter is True, regardless of the setting
! of this parameter.
!
lameOptionsMode:	0

! Command line options to be passed directly to the LAME MP3 encoder.
! If no option is to be set, use a single dash '-' character.
! See also the lameOptionsMode parameter.
!
! Example: If you set lameOptionsMode to 3, and specify
! "--alt-preset standard" in lameOptions, then xmcd/cda will only
! send the this command line option to LAME.  See the lame(1) man
! page for a full description of the supported options.
!
! Note: Only used for MP3.
!
lameOptions:		-

! Whether the CD should be spun-down after it is loaded.  This reduces
! wear on the drive if there won't be any audio playback activity for
! a while.

! This parameter, if set to True, overrides spinDownOnLoad.
!
playOnLoad:		False

! Whether the CD should be automatically ejected when done playing.
! "Done" means finished playing the last track on the CD in normal
! mode, or the last track in the shuffle or program mode play sequence.
! This option is only effective if the drive supports motorized eject.
!
ejectOnDone:		False

! Whether xmcd or the cda daemon should automatically exit when done
! playing.  "Done" means finished playing the last track on the CD in
! normal mode, or the last track in the shuffle or program mode play
! sequence.
!
exitOnDone:		False

! Whether the CD should be ejected on program exit.
! This option is only effective if the drive supports motorized eject.
!
ejectOnExit:		False

! Whether the CD should be stopped on program exit.
!
stopOnExit:		True

! Whether xmcd should exit when the CD is ejected.  Although this is
! a generic option, it is added primarily to make xmcd run better
! under Sun Solaris 2.x's Volume Manager and other similar auto-launchers.
! This option is only effective if the drive supports motorized eject.
!
! Note: If this parameter is set to True, then xmcd will exit after
! the CD is ejected, without the usual confirmation dialog box (as you
! would get when pressing the Quit button).
!
exitOnEject:		False

! Whether to enable the Repeat mode on program startup.
!
repeatMode:		False
