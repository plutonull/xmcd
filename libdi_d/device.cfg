! THIS IS THE DEVICE CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE FILE.  DO NOT MODIFY!
!
! Install a copy of this file as XMCDLIB/config/DEVNAME, and edit to suit
! the capability of the CD drive.  XMCDLIB is the XMcd.libdir resource
! (or XMCD_LIBDIR env variable) and DEVNAME is the device node path
! basename.
!
! These are the start-up default parameters for xmcd and cda.
! Users can also override some of these parameters by specifying them
! in an optional $HOME/.xmcdcfg/DEVNAME file.  Parameters that are
! labeled as "No-override" are privileged and cannot be overridden
! by the user in their private configuration files.
!
! The parameters in this file apply to a specific CD drive.
!
! cfgver=1	Do not remove this line.
!

! The logical drive number that you want this device to map to.  This
! number is displayed on the main window title bar.
! (No-override)
!
logicalDriveNumber:	0

! Default device list for the CD drive interface.  For a single-CD
! player, only one device should be listed.  For a multi-CD changer,
! there may be one or more devices in this list, depending upon the
! control interface.  Multiple devices are separated by a semi-colon ';'
! character.
!
! Examples:
!	/dev/cdrom0
!	/dev/rcdrom/c0b0t0d0;/dev/rcdrom/c0b0t0d1;/dev/rcdrom/c0b0t0d2
!
deviceList:		/dev/rcd0

! Default start-up playback mode.
!
! The supported modes are:
! 0	Standard playback
! 1	CDDA playback
! 2	CDDA save-to-file
! 4	CDDA pipe-to-program
!
! Multiple CDDA modes can be enabled at the same time. Just add the
! mode numbers.  For example, to enable both CDDA playback and CDDA
! save-to-file, specify mode 3.  This parameter is the start-up default.
! The mode can be changed via the user-interface.
!
! Note: CDDA modes are only supported on some OS platforms and with
! certain CD drives.
!
playMode:		0

! Device Interface Method: Configure xmcd/cda to control the CD drive
! via one of several methods.
!
! Note:
! Changing this parameter is useful only if your xmcd/cda binary is
! compiled to support the selected method.
!
! The supported methods are:
! 0	SCSI pass-through method		(Use this with SCSI drives)
! 1	SunOS/Solaris/Linux/QNX ioctl method	(For non-SCSI drives)
! 2	FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD ioctl method	(For non-SCSI drives)
! 3	IBM AIX IDE ioctl method		(For IDE/ATAPI drives)
!
! (No-override)
!
deviceInterfaceMethod:	0

! CDDA Method: Configure the method which xmcd/cda would employ to
! play audio using direct CDDA.
!
! The supported methods are:
! 0	None				(Don't do CDDA)
! 1	SYSV IPC method			(Use System V IPC)
! 2	POSIX threads method		(Use POSIX threads)
!
! Note: POSIX threads method is currently implemented only for some
!       platforms.  See the RELNOTES file for details.
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaMethod:		0

! CDDA read method: In CDDA mode, this selects which method is used to
! perform CDDA reads from the CD drive.
!
! The supported methods are:
! 0	None				(Don't read CDDA)
! 1	SCSI pass-through method	(Use this with SCSI drives)
! 2	Solaris ioctl method		(For Sun Solaris)
! 3	Linux ioctl method		(For Linux)
! 4	FreeBSD ioctl method		(For FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD)
! 5	AIX ATAPI/IDE ioctl method	(For IBM AIX)
!
! Note:
! a) Use the SCSI pass-through method for SCSI drives on all platforms
!    for best results.  This is true also for ATAPI/IDE drives under
!    SCSI emulation.
! b) The cddaReadMethod, if not set to 0, should be set to be consistent
!    with the deviceInterfaceMethod parameter.
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaReadMethod:		0

! CDDA write method: In CDDA mode, this select which method is used to
! output the digital audio stream to the audio device.

! 8	File & pipe only method		(File and pipe only: No audio playback)
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaWriteMethod:	0

! If cddaReadMethod is set to 1, this parameter selects whether a mode
! select SCSI command should be sent to the drive to enable CDDA
! mode prior to sending the read commands.  Setting this parameter to
! True will set the sector size of the device to CDDA mode (2352 bytes).
! This parameter is used only when in a CDDA mode.
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaScsiModeSelect:	True

! If cddaReadMethod is set to 1, this parameter selects which SCSI 
! command is used to read the CDDA.  Many drives support only one of
! these methods, many older drives do not support CDDA at all.
! This parameter is used only when in a CDDA mode.
!
! Valid values are:
! 0	MMC standard Read CD (12) command
! 1	SCSI standard Read (10) command
! 2	NEC vendor-unique Read CD-DA (10) command
! 3	Sony vendor-unique Read CD-DA (12) command
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaScsiReadCommand:	0

! If cddaScsiModeSelect is set to True, this parameter specifies the
! device density code to set via the Mode Select command.  Some drives
! require this in order to read the CDDA data in the correct format.
! This parameter is used only when in a CDDA mode.
!
! Common density codes used are 0 or 130 (0x82).  Only the decimal
! notation should be used here.  130 is usually needed on Toshiba SCSI
! drives.
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaScsiDensity:	0

! The default CDDA data read chunk size expressed in blocks.
! One second of playback is equal to 75 blocks.  Each block
! equals 2352 bytes of data.  The minimum limit of this parameter
! is 1 block and the maximum is 225 blocks.  This parameter is
! used only when in a CDDA mode.
!
! Note: The actual maximum limit is usually imposed by the platform's
! kernel CD-ROM and/or host bus adapter driver.  Increasing the chunk
! size may improve CDDA read performance (up to the limit imposed by
! the platform).  For CDDA save-to-file mode with individual files for
! each track, a larger chunk size will cause an increase of a shift error
! in the time position where one file ends and another starts.  This is
! because the current xmcd implementation will switch to a new file
! only at a chunk boundary, which doesn't always coincide with the actual
! track boundary.  The shift is at worst 0.05 second when this parameter
! is set to 4.
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaReadChunkBlocks:    8

! This parameter indicates whether the CDDA data as read from the
! drive is in big-endian byte order.  If CDDA playback produces something
! that sounds like white noise, try changing the value of this parameter.
! This parameter is used only when in a CDDA mode.
!
! (No-override)
!
cddaDataBigEndian:	False

! Whether to do overlapped CDDA reads for jitter correction.  Jitter
! correction causes some sectors to be read twice.  It is used
! to eliminate clicks and pops in the sound.  If you have very fast
! hardware or an error-free drive, you can gain performance
! in CDDA save-to-file mode by setting this parameter to False.
! This parameter is the start-up default, and can be changed via
! the user-interface.  It is used only when in a CDDA mode.
!
cddaJitterCorrection:	False

! CD drive vendor code.  If your CD drive is not SCSI-2 compliant,
! this is used to specify that xmcd should issue vendor-unique commands
! rather than SCSI-2 commands.
!
! Note:
! a) This parameter is only used for SCSI drives (i.e.,
!    the deviceInterfaceMethod parameter is set to 0).
! b) Changing this parameter is useful only if your xmcd/cda binary is
!    compiled to provide vendor-unique commands support.
! c) The existence of a vendor-unique module does not imply that all
!    models of CD drive made by that manufacturer must use the vendor-
!    unique mode.  For example, the Toshiba XM-3301/3401 and Sony
!    CDU-541/561 are SCSI-2 compliant and should use vendor code 0.
!
! The supported codes are:
! 0	SCSI-2 standard
! 1	Chinon vendor-unique
! 2	Hitachi vendor-unique
! 3	NEC vendor-unique
! 4	Pioneer vendor-unique
! 5	Sony vendor-unique
! 6	Toshiba vendor-unique
! 7	Panasonic/Matsushita vendor-unique
!
! (No-override)
!
driveVendorCode:	0

! Whether xmcd/cda should check the SCSI version of the drive against
! the configured SCSI version.  If this is set to True and a mismatch

! deviceInterfaceMethod is 0 and driveVendorCode is 0. 
!
! (No-override)
!
scsiVersionCheck:	False

! The number of discs a multi-CD changer drive supports.  For a
! single-CD drive, this parameter should be set to 1.

! The method to use when changing discs in a multi-CD changer.
!
! The supported methods are:
! 0	Single-CD drive: no changer
! 1	SCSI LUN addressing method
! 2	SCSI medium changer method
! 3	OS-ioctl method (for non-SCSI drives)
!
! (no-override)
!
mediumChangeMethod:	0

! The base SCSI audio volume value that corresponds to the minimum
! setting of the volume control slider.  This is used to adjust the
! range of audio volume control.  The legal range is 0 to 255.
! This parameter is used only if volumeControlSupport is True.
! (No-override)
!
scsiAudioVolumeBase:	0

! will be used.
! (No-override)
!
modeSenseUse10Byte:	False

! Whether the CD drive supports setting the audio playback volume
! in software.  For SCSI-2 drives, this means the audio page (0xE) of
! the Mode Select SCSI command.  For SCSI-1 drives, this is vendor-
! unique.
! (No-override)
!
volumeControlSupport:	True

! Whether the CD drive supports setting the audio playback volume

! This parameter is meaningful only if pauseResumeSupport is True.
! (No-override)
!
strictPauseResume:	False

! While playing audio, if the CD drive requires a pause command to be
! sent before accepting a new play audio command, set this to True.
! This parameter is meaningful only if pauseResumeSupport is True.
! (No-override)
!
playPausePlay:		False

! Whether the CD drive supports the Prevent/Allow Medium Removal
! SCSI command.  If this item is False, it will also automatically
! force the caddyLock parameter to False.
! (No-override)
!
caddyLockSupport:	True

! must be set correctly in order for the LBA mode to work.
! (No-override)
!
subChannelLBA:		False

! The CD drive's native block size in bytes.  Standard CD drives
! have 2048-byte blocks, but some platforms (Notably older Sun and SGI)
! have CD drives with 512-byte blocks to mimick a hard disk drive.
! (No-override)
!
driveBlockSize:		2048

! When spinning up the CD, how long to wait (in seconds) for the disc
! to spin up to speed before accessing the drive again.
! (No-override)

! 2	Apply an inverse-squared taper (big change at low settings,
!	diminishing as the slider moves toward the upper range).
!
volumeControlTaper:	0

! This allows the volume control setting to be pre-set when xmcd/cda
! first starts.  If set to -1, xmcd/cda will query the CD drive's
! internal setting and set the volume slider to match.  This will have
! an effect only if the drive and driver supports the appropriate
! functionality.  Valid settings for the parameter is 0-100 and -1.
startupVolume:		-1
