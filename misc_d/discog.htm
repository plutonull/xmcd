<H2>Introduction</H2>
<DIR>
<P>
Welcome to xmcd <I>Local Discography</I>.  This is a storage area on
your system that can be used to collect and organize files related to
each CD you own.  The files can be text, HTML or other documents,
image or animation files, sound clips, etc.  Examples are music reviews,
artist interviews, photographs, fan information, MP3 sound files etc.
You can download these from fan sites on the Internet, or create your own.
You can make local web pages that contain links to Internet
sites, or links to files associated with other CDs in Local Discography.
<P>
These files can be viewed, played and/or printed using the <I>wwwWarp</I>
feature of xmcd.  Xmcd will drive an external web browser to access
the files.
<P>
</DIR>
<H2>Directory Organization</H2>
<DIR>
<P>
The top-level Local Discography directory is <B>$DISCOGDIR</B>
on your system.  This was created when xmcd was installed.
Under this directory there are hierarchy of directories of music genres
(i.e., <I>Rock, Classical, Jazz,</I> etc.).  These genres match those
of the CDDB<SUP>2</SUP> service.  Xmcd automatically creates the genre and
sub-genre directories, as well as the per-CD directories.
When you select the &quot;Xmcd Local Discography&quot; entry in xmcd's
<I>wwwWarp</I> menu, your web browser will go to a xmcd-generated web
page about the CD that is currently loaded.
<P>
The Local Discography directory path pertaining to the CD is displayed
on the web browser when you select &quot;Xmcd Local Discography&quot;.
Scroll the browser to the bottom of the page.
<P>
</DIR>
<H2>Setup Instructions</H2>
<DIR>
<P>
No setup in xmcd is necessary to use <I>wwwWarp</I> and Local Discography.
However, you must have a supported and functioning web browser installed
on your system.
<P>
<H4>Web browser configuration</H4>
<P>
Your system must have the
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org" TARGET="_blank">Mozilla</A>,
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com" TARGET="_blank">Netscape</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.galeon.org" TARGET="_blank">Galeon</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.opera.com" TARGET="_blank">Opera</A>
web browser software installed in order to use xmcd's <I>wwwWarp</I>
and Local Discography features.  Other web browsers will not work
correctly with <I>wwwWarp</I>.
<P>
In order to reach Internet sites via <I>wwwWarp</I>, your system must
be connected to the Internet.  However, the Local Discography feature
does not require an Internet connection.
<P>
If your system is within a firewall, and requires the use of a proxy server
to access the Internet, then your web browser must be appropriately
configured.  See your local system administrator about configuring your
web browser.  To test internet accessibility, start your web browser
and enter <B>$XMCD_URL</B> in the location bar.  This should
take you to the Xmcd official web site.
<P>
To test xmcd's <I>wwwWarp</I> capability, start xmcd and click on the
<I>wwwWarp</I> button (the one with the world symbol).  Choose the
&quot;<B>Xmcd official web site</B>&quot; entry in the menu.  This should
cause your web browser to go to the Xmcd official web site.
<P>
Normally xmcd will search your system and automatically invoke a
supported web browser on your system when you use <I>wwwWarp</I>
and Local Discography.  However, if one of the following conditions occur:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Xmcd cannot locate a supported web browser on your system.
<LI>You have multiple browsers installed, and xmcd is invoking an
    undesired version.
</UL>
<P>
The remedy is to define the full path to the browser executable
in the BROWSER_PATH environment variable.  If you use Bourne Shell,
Korn Shell or similar, add the following to your $HOME/.profile file:
<P>
<PRE>
	BROWSER_PATH=/usr/local/bin/mozilla
	export BROWSER_PATH
</PRE>
<P>
If you use C-Shell or similar, add the following to your $HOME/.cshrc file:
<P>
<PRE>
	setenv BROWSER_PATH /usr/local/bin/mozilla
</PRE>
<P>
Substitute <I>/usr/local/bin/mozilla</I> above with the actual path to
your desired browser executable.  Log out and log in again to have this
take effect.
<P>
<H4>Local Discography directories</H4>
<P>
When xmcd is installed for the first time, the top level Local Discography
directory as well as some basic music genre subdirectories are created
for you.  When xmcd or cda gets a successful CDDB<SUP>2</SUP> query of
CD information, it automatically creates the Local Discography directory
for the loaded CD.
<P>
An HTML index file is also automatically installed by xmcd and cda
in each CD's Local Discography directory.  This is the file that xmcd will
point your web browser to, when you view a CD's Local Discography.
<P>
You can put other related files in each CD's Local Discography directory,
such as images and sound clips.  These files will automatically appear
in the CD's Local Discography when you use xmcd's wwwWarp system to
view it.
<P>
Xmcd and cda will also automatically create the index files for browsing
your Local Discography directories.  Once you start loading and playing
your CDs in the drive, you will find that your Local Discography
will grow, and you can go to the Main Index to browse your CD collection
by the genres and subgenres.
<P>
You are now ready to use Local Discography!
<P>
</DIR>
<H2>How to Use</H2>
<DIR>
<P>
To use Local Discography, start xmcd and load a CD in the drive.
Click on the <B>wwwWarp</B> button on xmcd's main window (this is
the button with the world symbol).  A <I>wwwWarp</I> menu will pop up.
Choose the "<B>Xmcd Local Discography</B>" entry, and your
web browser will go to the appropriate entry.
<P>
The web browser will display the artist, disc title and track title
information about the currently loaded CD, as well as other information
from the CDDB<SUP>2</SUP> service.
<P>
Disc and track titles on the Local Discography page are usually clickable
hyperlinks, that causes a search to be done on the CDDB search engine.
<P>
If there are other files in the directory, the browser will also
display a listing of those files.  You can click on a file to view
or play it.  Note that your web brower may need certain plug-ins in
order to open or play some file formats.
<P>
The page will also display hyperlinks (URLs), if any are found in the
Disc Notes or Track Notes portions of the CD information.
<P>
</DIR>
<H2>Copyrights</H2>
<DIR>
<P>
Please be aware of possible legal implications when sharing music-related
files with others.  Some of the information, including album cover art,
graphics and photos, lyrics and other data are likely to be protected by
copyright.  Xmcd and its author are not liable for the users' actions.
