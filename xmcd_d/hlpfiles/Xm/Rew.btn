Rewind Search Button

Select this button and hold it down to search backward
while audio playback is in progress.  You will hear
short samples of the audio during the search.  When you
release the button, the search ends and normal playback
resumes at the new location.

If you hold the button down for longer than a certain
amount of time, the search speed increases.

During shuffle or program mode, you cannot search beyond
the start of the current playing track.

During segment play mode, you cannot search beyond the
start of the segment.

If the playback state is paused when the search operation
is started, it will remain paused (at the new location)
when the search ends.
