Basic / Normal Mode Selector Button

Select this button to change the main window mode.
You may toggle between the following modes:

	Normal:	full feature mode
	Basic:	small footprint mode

The "normal" mode provide the full set of xmcd 
controls and displays.

The "basic" mode provides only a small set of
essentual controls and display, but allows xmcd
to occupy a very small screen space.  All hot-keys
remain operable in the basic mode, including those
associated with controls that are not present in
basic mode.
