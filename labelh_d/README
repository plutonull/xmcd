@(#)README	7.1 01/12/28

This is a simple hack widget written by John L. Cwikla <cwikla@wolfram.com>
to provide 3D labels for Motif Label and LabelGadget widgets while they are
insensitive rather than the default "50_foreground" stippled label.

If the depth is <= 4 it will just use the regular stuff since it
won't look right.

See the COPYRIGHT file for information about this widget.
