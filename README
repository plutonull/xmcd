Xmcd is a full-featured CD player and ripper utility package including
xmcd, a CD Player/Ripper for the X window system using the Motif graphical
user interface; and cda, a command-line driven, text mode CD Player/Ripper
which also features a curses-based, screen-oriented mode.  Both utilities
transform your computer's CD or DVD drive into a stereo CD player,
allowing you to play audio CDs on your computer.  On many platforms
with capable hardware, these utilities can also perform digital audio
extraction (DAE) from audio CDs and play the CD digital audio (CDDA)
stream real-time, save it to file in various compressed and uncompressed
formats, as well as pipe it to an external program for other processing.
More than one CDDA operation can even be be done simultaneously on systems
and peripherals with sufficient performance.

The following is a summary of xmcd/cda documentation files.  Please
read these before installing and using the software.

Many of these files refer to the XMCDLIB directory, which is the
directory under which all the xmcd/cda support files are installed.
This is configured when you install the xmcd package.

The documentation files are located in the docs_d subdirectory in the
xmcd source code distribution, and are copied to the XMCDLIB/docs
directory during installation.

The files denoted with (*) are included only in the source code
distribution of xmcd.

After installation, you can use the man(1) or xman(1) command to read
the on-line manual entry for xmcd(1) and cda(1).  Also, you may also

Xmcd and cda uses the LAME encoder software for CD ripping to the MP3
format.  Similarly, the FAAC encoder software is used for the MPEG-2,
MPEG-4 AAC and MP4 formats.  Please note that due to patents pertaining
to the MP3, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 technologies, it may be illegal to
download and use the LAME and FAAC encoder software without incurring
licensing royalties in some countries.  MP3 is currently licensed by
Thomson (http://www.mp3licensing.com), while MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 AAC are
licensed by Via Licensing Corporation (http://www.vialicensing.com),
a subsidiary of Dolby Laboratories.  It is for this reason that LAME
and FAAC are not included in xmcd's source code or pre-compiled binary
kits.  You must download and install them separately in order to enable
the MP3, AAC and MP4 file formats in xmcd.

Likewise, xmcd and cda uses the Ogg Vorbis and FLAC encoder libraries
for these respective formats.  However, since these formats are fully
open, patent-and-royalty-free; the pre-compiled xmcd binary kits from
the official xmcd web site have the appropriate libraries statically
linked.  You do not need to download and install these libraries when
using the xmcd pre-compiled binary kits to get enable these formats.

If you are compiling xmcd from the source code, you must download and
install the Ogg Vorbis and FLAC library packages.  See the INSTALL file
for details.

Please refer to the official xmcd "Downloads" web site for links to sites
that offer source code and pre-compiled binaries of LAME, Ogg Vorbis,
FLAC and FAAC.
